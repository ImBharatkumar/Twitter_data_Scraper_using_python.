# Twitter_data_Scraper_using_python.
I have created a web app named TwitterdataScraper using Streamlit framework and python.

## =>Why snscrape?
'''Snscrape is another approach for scraping information from Twitter that does not require the use of an API. Snscrape allows you to scrape basic information such as a user's profile, tweet content, source, and so on.
Snscrape is not limited to Twitter, but can also scrape content from other prominent social media networks like Facebook, Instagram, and others.
Its advantages are that there are no limits to the number of tweets you can retrieve or the window of tweets (that is, the date range of tweets). So Snscrape allows you to retrieve old data.

#### step 1) install streamlit in the conda environment and make a directory.
install using- cmd => pip install streamlit

#### step2) create a Python file in the same directory.

#### step3)code=>
code present in GUI.py file

# step 4
##usage
clone this repository to your local machine using command (git clone https://github.com/ImBharatkumar/Twitter_data_Scraper_using_python..git)

#### Open the terminal from the conda environment where you have installed streamlit.

#### Result:
#you will be re-directed to an interactive website, where you can scrape and download the Twitter data in json and csv format
